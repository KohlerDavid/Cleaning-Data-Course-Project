# Code book

1. In a first step the data was downloaded and extracted form the folder UCI HAR Dataset

2. The data which is in "txt, format was imported into R and thereby the data is assigned to a variable 

# data frame features--> consists of two variables with name n and functions. The functions are the names
of the columns in the data_frame x_test and y_test /561 obs. of  2 variables:
# data frame activities-> two variables first one is number called code which is linked to desciption of the activity in the second 
column e.g. code 1 = WALKING /6 obs. of  2 variables
#subject_test--> one varaiable "subject" which contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed / 2947 obs. of  1 variable:
#subject_train-->one varaiable "subject" which contains contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed / 7352 obs. of  1 variable:
#x_test-> data frame which take test data and adds the names of columns from the data frame feature column function / 2947 obs. of  561 variables
#x_train-> data frame which take train data and adds the names of columns from the data frame feature column function /7352 obs. of  561 variables
#y_test-> data frame which has one column call code which descripes the activty through a number/ 2947 obs. of  1 variable
#y_train-> data frame which has one column call code which descripes the activty through a number / 7352 obs. of  1 variable

3. Merging of the all the train and test data

#df_test-> all the test data from above (x_test,y_test,subject_test) where merged in one df using cbind / 2947 obs. of  563 variables
#df_train-> all the train data from above (x_train,y_train,subject_train) where merged in one df using cbind / 7352 obs. of  563 variables

#final_data-> rbind of df_train and df_test giving a new dataframe which contains all the data /10299 obs. of  563 variables

4. Extraction of measurements which contain mean or std in column name

# df selected is created which contains the columns which contain mean or std in there name / 10299 obs. of  563 variables

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
# Entire numbers in code column of the final_data replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable 
and safed in a new df called final_data_names_activity

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names ◦code column in final_data_names_activity renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

gives column names like:

[2] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.mean...X"                      
  [3] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.mean...Y"                      
  [4] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.mean...Z"                      
  [5] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.std...X"                       
  [6] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.std...Y"                       
  [7] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.std...Z"                       
  [8] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.mad...X"                       
  [9] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.mad...Y"                       
 [10] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.mad...Z"                       
 [11] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.max...X"                       
 [12] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.max...Y"                       
 [13] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.max...Z"                       
 [14] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.min...X"                       
 [15] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.min...Y"                       
 [16] "TimeBodyAccelerometer.min...Z"                       
 
 etc...

7. From the data final_data_names_activity creates a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 

FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing final_data_names_activity taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
